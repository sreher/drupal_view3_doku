A row style is an individual style to display only an individual record within a view. You can choose between <a href="topic:views/style-node">node</a> or <a href="topic:views/style-fields">fields</a>. For example, a node type view would display one node per row; a user type view would display one user per row. 

When you choose <strong>fields</strong>, you have to add some entries in the <a href="topic:views/field">Fields</a> section to produce an output. To set some option about fields, read <a href="topic:views/style-fields">here</a>. 

Some row styles use <em>fields</em> which means you select from the available fields to display; others do not; they are able to use the base type and create a display. Usually, row styles that do not use fields <em>produce less efficient (slower) views</em>, so bear this in mind when contemplating the performance of your site.

When you choose <strong>node</strong> the complete node will display through Drupal's standard <em>node_view()</em> function. You can choose some <a href="topic:views/style-node">options</a>.
